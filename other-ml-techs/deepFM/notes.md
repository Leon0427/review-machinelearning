1. all in all, deep FM is aimed to learn from sophisticated feature interactions
2. it emphasizes both low and high-order feature interactions
3. the key challenge is effectively modelling feature interactions
4. comparing with wide & deep, deep FM's wide and deep part share one same input as well as the embeddings
5. the latent vector Vi, Vj could be learning from data set even if there are't appear in same example
